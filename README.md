📘 User Invite Autocomplete Component

A modular, production-ready email input with validation, tooltips, hidden chip handling, and Docker support.

⸻

✨ Quick Start

🟢 Install dependencies

npm install

If your project doesn’t already have MUI installed, also run:

npm install @mui/material @mui/icons-material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

⸻

🟢 Start the development server
• Vite:

npm run dev

Runs locally at http://localhost:5173

    •	Create React App:

npm start

Runs locally at http://localhost:3000

⸻

🟢 Build and run in Docker

docker-compose up --build

This:

✅ Builds the production bundle
✅ Serves it via Nginx
✅ Exposes it at http://localhost:3000

🧩 Project Overview

This component lets users input and manage multiple emails, with:

✅ Inline chips for the first few emails
✅ A “+X” chip showing how many are hidden
✅ A popper dropdown for hidden emails
✅ Tooltips on chips to display full email addresses
✅ Validation of email syntax

⸻

🛠 File Structure and Responsibilities

File Purpose
UserInviteAutocomplete.tsx The main component orchestrating state, handlers, and layout.
useEmailInvite.ts Custom hook encapsulating all logic: state, validation, error handling, and popper control.
InviteInput.tsx MUI <Autocomplete> input showing visible chips and “+X” chip for hidden ones.
InviteChip.tsx Single chip with tooltip, used in both visible area and popper.
HiddenChipsPopper.tsx Dropdown showing hidden chips with remove actions.

💡 Design Decisions
• Validation Regex:
Simple pattern for email addresses:
/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/
• Parent-managed state:
The emails array is stored in the parent to keep submission and display logic centralized.
• MUI Autocomplete in freeSolo mode:
Enables typing any email and confirming with Enter.
• Tooltips and truncation:
Long emails show as ellipsis with a tooltip on hover.
• Popper for hidden chips:
Clean UI when there are many emails, instead of wrapping onto multiple lines.

⸻

🛠 Challenges and How We Solved Them
• TypeScript Types:
MUI Autocomplete with freeSolo + multiple produced string | never[] issues.
✅ Solution: Explicit casting to string[].
• Render Value Desync:
Using only selected in renderValue caused hidden chips to desync from parent state.
✅ Solution: Passed emails prop to keep state consistent.
• Error Handling:
Validation errors needed clear feedback without cluttering input.
✅ Solution: Error message rendered below the field.

⸻

🎨 How to Customize
• Max visible chips:
Adjust the maxVisibleChips prop in UserInviteAutocomplete.tsx.
• Validation logic:
Update the regex in useEmailInvite.ts.
• Styling:
All layouts use MUI <Box> and sx props—override styles as needed.
• Submission handling:
Replace the console.log() in the Add Users button with your API call.

🧪 Example Usage

Import and use in your app:

import { UserInviteAutocomplete } from "./components/userInviteAutocomplete/UserInviteAutocomplete";

export default function App() {
return <UserInviteAutocomplete />;
}
